                {r}{o}Aperture server command{r}. This command can be used to make given player (by an entity selector) start playing camera profile.

                {r}If you pass only {7}<target|camera_profile>{r}, then the given camera profile will be played back on you. If you pass two arguments after {8}play{r}, then you would be able to specify both player (using username or target selector) and camera profile.

                {r}Set camera's angle based on absolute or relative values. You can set absolute angle of the camera by specifying plain floating point numbers {6}/camera {8}rotate {7}90 90{r}. Or you can provide a relative value by using {7}~+{r} or {7}~-{r} signs {6}/camera {8}rotate {7}~0.5 ~-0.5{r}.
        
        step:
            |

                {r}Set camera's position based on absolute or relative values. You can set absolute position of the camera by specifying plain floating point numbers {6}/camera {8}step {7}0 4 0{r}. Or you can provide a relative value by using {7}~+{r} or {7}~-{r} signs {6}/camera {8}step {7}~0 ~0.1 ~0{r}. It works similar to {6}/tp{r} command.

                    {r}Can be used to set, or to get duration of whole camera profile or one camera fixture. If all arguments are present, the command sets the {7}[duration]{r} in ticks to given fixture at given {7}[index]{r}. Relative values can be used for {7}[duration]{r} argument.
